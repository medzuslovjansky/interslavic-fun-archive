Besides, Russia has always been a huge empire, a regional superpower, and it is the only Slavic country with an unbroken tradition of statehood. Not surprisingly, Russian has been advocated as a Pan-Slavic language mostly by Russian Pan-Slavists, who have always made it abundantly clear that Russian hegemony is a conditio sine qua non for a Slavic state, and this is precisely why the idea never gained much popularity among the smaller Slavic nations. Even though they recognise their cultural ties with Russia, they refuse be treated as \u201edisfigured Russians\u201c and most them do not have the best experience with Russian domination. In addition, Russian is not a simple language and it has numerous features that make it hard to understand for speakers of other Slavic languages."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Another popular candidate is ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Old Church Slavonic"),", the oldest written Slavic language, codified (or created, according to some) in the 9th century by the brothers St. Cyril and St. Method. This language has several advantages: it is very closely related to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, and has a long tradition of use in Orthodox liturgy, thus being both a common ground and a common influence for many Slavic languages. It has the additional advantage of not being anybody's native language, so that it can easily be put forward as a neutral, international language similar to Latin or Sanskrit. In spite of these assets, however, Old Church Slavonic has several practical drawbacks as well. The fact that it was positioned as a sacred language has made it particularly resistant to change, so that even the later \u201eredactions\u201c are little more than the original with some ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"couleur locale")," mixed in. As a result, Old Church Slavonic has an abundantly rich orthography containing several characters and sounds that have fallen out of use, an equally rich and therefore complicated grammar, and an extremely archaic vocabulary, featuring words that have not survived in any of the contemporary languages, yet lacking words for modern concepts. As early as the 17th century Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, arguably the first Pan-Slavist, noted that Old Church Slavonic had become too archaic to be feasible as a Pan-Slavic language. In other words, it would require some thorough modernisation, and this is where ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Interslavic")," comes in. Interslavic, one might say, begins where Old Church Slavonic ends."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Kri\u017eani\u0107 was the first to actually describe a language, which he named ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Ruski")," in an effort to please the tsar, but which was in fact a mix of Russian Church Slavonic and Croatian, as well as elements from other Slavic languages, notably Polish. It was completed in 1666 and is often quoted as the first constructed Interslavic language. In later years, his example has been followed by many others. In the 19th century, when Pan-Slavism was at its peak, another ten projects by Czech, Slovak, Slovene and Croatian authors saw the light. Of these, most elaborate were: ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Universalis Lingua Slavica"),", published in 1826 by the Slovak J\xe1n Herke\u013e, a language based primarily on the West Slavic languages; ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Vsjeslovian\u044csky\u044c"),", based on Church Slavonic and published in 1861 by the Czech Vaceslav Bambas; and ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski"),", published in 1865 by the Slovene Matija Majar-Ziljski. Whereas most projects were aimed at reviving and modernising (Old) Church Slavonic, Majar chose an entirely different approach. His project was based on the idea that Slavs could make themselves better understandable to other Slavs taking their own language as a starting point and then gradually modifying it. The first step in that process was altering the orthography, resulting in a generic (\u201emutual\u201c) Pan-Slavic orthography. Subsequently, he proposed a grammar that was based on linguistic comparison of the five major Slavic languages of those days: Russian, Polish, Czech, Serbian and Old Church Slavonic."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"In the 20th century, several new projects appeared, mostly by Czech authors.

On the other hand, Ladislav Podmele's naturalistic ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Me\u017eduslavjanski jezik")," from the 1950s was based mostly on Russian, probably due to the political reality of those days."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Although most of the afore-mentioned projects were elaborate and used in various publications, they were isolated efforts by individual people, and it seems unlikely that any of them has ever had a considerable following. The digital age opened many new possibilities for Interslavic. First of all, the growing possibilities for interaction with people in other countries, on mailing lists, internet fora etc. spawned a renewed interest in a language that would be understandable to Slavs of different nationalities. Secondly, Interslavic was no longer the domain of linguists and Pan-Slavists anymore, and everybody now had the chance to share his ideas on the Internet. And thirdly, thanks to the new means of communication, authors were no longer forced to work in isolation. Thus, in the early years of the 21th century, we witness a shift from solo projects towards collaborative projects, followed by a tendency towards their integration. The first collaborative project was called ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovo"),", active in 2001-2002 but discontinued afterwards."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Collaborative projects had some major advantages over solo projects. Previous projects, no matter how well-built, had always been coloured by the ethnicity of their authors, most of whom had traditionally been Czechs, Slovenes and Croats. For the first time, input from Russians, Poles, Serbs and Bulgarians started playing a role, too. Because people of different nationalities were in constant contact with each other and had access to the same sources, it became possible to do something that had never been done before, namely building an Interslavic dictionary. Besides, a language project that was worked on by a collective instead of an individual author, immediately had a rudimentary user community and testing range at its disposal."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovianski project")," was started in March 2006, partly in response to the highly artificial character of Slovio, at the time the only active Slavic-based constructed language around. It was based on the same concept of linguistic comparison that had also been applied by Majar-Ziljski. All the living Slavic languages with at least 1 million speakers were taken into account, in such way that West, East and South Slavic were given equal weight. In the early days of the project, the authors experimented with different versions of the language. ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovianski-P")," (the letter ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"P")," refers to the word ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"pidgin")," or ",(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"prosti"),", the Slavic word for \u201esimple\u201c), first proposed by Ondrej Re\u010dnik and later adopted by Gabriel Svoboda, was intended to become a highly simplified language, built along similar lines as pidgin languages. ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovianski-N")," (the letter ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"N")," stands for \u201enaturalism\u201c), initiated by Jan van Steenbergen and later elaborated by Igor Polyakov, was based on everything the Slavic languages have in common, including their case system. At last, ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovianski-S")," (the letter ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"S")," stands for \u201eschematicism\u201c) was an effort of Gabriel Svoboda (",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"GS-Slovianski"),") and Igor Polyakov (",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovjanskaj"),") to create a language that would combine schematicism with naturalism. All three of them worked as separate sister projects, or \u201edialects\u201c, based on different grammar models, but sharing one orthography, phonology and vocabulary. Gradually, Slovianski-S and Slovianski-P were abandoned, and in 2009 it was decided that Slovianski-N would carry the name ",(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Slovianski"),", while Slovianski-P would continue to exist as a simplified version of it, useful for communication with Bulgarians, Macedonians and non-Slavs."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Meanwhile, separate efforts were undertaken to bridge the gap between Slovianski and Slovio by combining (a modified form of) Slovianski grammar with Slovio's larger dictionary.

Unlike Rozumio, Slovioski quickly developed into a separate language project. The original idea was to replace Slovio's grammar with a more naturalistic one, while basically sticking to the Slovio dictionary.
