Some of them put more weight on simplicity than others. Some are based on Old Church Slavonic or reconstructed Proto-Slavic, others draw their material from the modern languages. What all these proposals have in common though, is that they simplify grammar to a certain degree, use an orthography that is more in line with contemporary needs and possibilities, replace archaic features with modern material, and seek the middle point between multiple, if not all, Slavic languages. Obviously, these projects are not identical to each other, but the differences between them are not significant in the sense that understandability is dramatically affected. A language based on comparating the modern languages will differ from a modernised Proto-Slavic only in details; both approaches can easily be combined in one dictionary.

First of all, is it a natural or a constructed language? Natural (or ethnic) languages are languages that have evolved slowly and gradually as a result of constant social interaction between their speakers against the background of a culture. For that reason, Interslavic is not strictly a natural language, because it never had any native speakers. By contrast, constructed languages are always created within a relatively short time span by a specific, usually identifiable person or group.

Despite many efforts at standardising it, Interslavic is primarily what those who use it, make of it themselves."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,'There is no binary distinction between natural and constructed languages. Instead, both are extremes on a broad scale of artificiality. Some natural languages contain more invented elements than others, and especially language standardisation often involves top-down engineering by a regulating body. Several standardised languages, such as Modern Hebrew and Rumantsch Grischun, even have an author and a year of creation, but nevertheless, they are always listed among the natural languages. Languages of this type belong to the grey area between natural and constructed languages and could be called "semiconstructed languages".

However, sacrificing Slavic grammar on the altar of regularity and simplicity would render the language strange and unfamiliar to Slavic speakers. Besides, communication in a schematic language requires that both sides (speaker/writer and listener/reader) know the rules, whereas a well-designed naturalistic language has the advantage of being understood by virtually anyone who knows a Slavic language, which makes it particularly suitable for one-way communication. For that reason, almost all Interslavic projects past and present have chosen the naturalistic approach.

Just like it would be pointless for Slavs to use an un-Slavic grammar, there is no reason why non-Slavs who only wish to make themselves understandable to Slavs, should plough his way through tables with Slavic declensions and conjugations. Interslavic needs to be flexible enough to offer solutions to both. To achieve this, we also provide a simplified grammar and orthography level, intended mostly for beginners and non-Slavs. It has a minimalistic grammar and phonology, and is based on the improvised ad hoc languages that have existed for centuries in multi-Slavic environments, nowadays also on the Internet."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Because speakers of pidgin languages do not know each other's native language, they do not know what their languages really have in common either.
