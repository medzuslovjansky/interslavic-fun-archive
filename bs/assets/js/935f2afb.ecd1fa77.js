It has grammatical gender, six cases plus an optional vocative, verbal aspect and full conjugation \u2013 things that virtually every Slav is familiar with. In addition, it also contains some material that is absent in most Slavic languages, but knowledge of which can be of great help in understanding the languages that use it.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/nouns":{"id":"learn/grammar/nouns","title":"Nouns","description":"Like most Slavic languages, nouns in Interslavic have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), two numbers (singular, plural) and seven cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, locative, vocative). The vocative, used for addressing a person or object directly, is actually not a real case, as it behaves significantly different from other cases: it exists only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns, it never affects adjectives or pronouns, and it has nothing to do with the syntactic structure of the sentence.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/numerals":{"id":"learn/grammar/numerals","title":"Numerals","description":"(\u010cislovniky)","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/prepositions":{"id":"learn/grammar/prepositions","title":"Prepositions","description":"Conjunctions","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/pronouns":{"id":"learn/grammar/pronouns","title":"Pronouns","description":"(Zaimenniky)","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/syntax":{"id":"learn/grammar/syntax","title":"Syntax","description":"(Sintaksa)","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/grammar/verbs":{"id":"learn/grammar/verbs","title":"Verbs","description":"Perfective and imperfective aspect","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/constructed-slavic-languages":{"id":"learn/introduction/constructed-slavic-languages","title":"Constructed Slavic languages","description":"Um\u011btne slovjanske jezyky","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/design-criteria":{"id":"learn/introduction/design-criteria","title":"Design criteria","description":"Interslavic is based on the common heritage of all Slavic nations, and differences are bridged by building compromises. All Slavic languages are treated equally, although it cannot be avoided that a Slavic interlanguage is closer to \u201emiddle-of-the-road\u201c languages like Slovak or Rusyn than to peripheral languages like Sorbian or Macedonian. Interslavic is explicitly not meant to be \u201emore Slavic than the Slavs\u201c by purifying it from foreign influences, even though a language based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages will automatically eliminate many local (non-Slavic) influences anyway. There is, however, no reason to exclude international vocabulary, provided that it can be recognised by all, or at least most, Slavic speakers.","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/faq":{"id":"learn/introduction/faq","title":"Frequently asked questions","description":"How to learn and use Interslavic?","sidebar":"learnSidebar"},"learn/introduction/history":{"id":"learn/introduction/history","title":"History of Interslavic","description":"The history of the Interslavic language is closely connected with Pan-Slavism, an ideology that believes that the Slavs are one nation and aims at their cultural and political unification.
