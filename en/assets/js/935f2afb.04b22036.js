All Slavic languages are treated equally, although it cannot be avoided that a Slavic interlanguage is closer to \u201emiddle-of-the-road\u201c languages like Slovak or Rusyn than to peripheral languages like Sorbian or Macedonian. Interslavic is explicitly not meant to be \u201emore Slavic than the Slavs\u201c by purifying it from foreign influences, even though a language based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages will automatically eliminate many local (non-Slavic) influences anyway. There is, however, no reason to exclude international vocabulary, provided that it can be recognised by all, or at least most, Slavic speakers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"faq":{"id":"faq","title":"Pytanja / V\xf2prosy","description":"How to learn and use Interslavic?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/adjectives":{"id":"grammar/adjectives","title":"Adjectives","description":"Inflection","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/conjunctions":{"id":"grammar/conjunctions","title":"Conjunctions","description":"A conjunction is a part of speech that connects two words, sentences, phrases or clauses together.

The vocative, used for addressing a person or object directly, is actually not a real case, as it behaves significantly different from other cases: it exists only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns, it never affects adjectives or pronouns, and it has nothing to do with the syntactic structure of the sentence.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/numerals":{"id":"grammar/numerals","title":"Numerals","description":"Cardinal numbers","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/orthography":{"id":"grammar/orthography","title":"Orthography","description":"Standard alphabet","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/phonology":{"id":"grammar/phonology","title":"Phonology","description":"Phoneme inventory","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/prepositions":{"id":"grammar/prepositions","title":"Prepositions","description":"Most prepositions in Slovianski govern the genitive.

Grammar is limited to a bare minimum, and forms that are not strictly necessary are not used at all. Because it does not contain anything that cannot be found in the Slavic languages, the result wil not look or sound too awkward to Slavic speakers, but rather remind them of the kind of language used by small children.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"grammar/simplified/2":{"id":"grammar/simplified/2","title":"Simplified grammar: Level 2","description":"In Slovianto, level 1 you have learned a number of forms that can you can use to make yourself understandable to Slavs on a very basic level.
