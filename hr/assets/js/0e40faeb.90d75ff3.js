Polish did have "\xf3" formerly in some places consistent with the reflexes in other languages, but it turned to a simple "o" in the modern language (like the "k\xf3\u0144" vs "ko\u0144" example), but I haven\'t been able to find info about the form "p\xf3d", which means it\'s possibly unique to Ukrainian. Like mentioned at the start, this would be the hardest and most work--intensive flavorization to get to work with high accuracy, but this can prbably be determined by trained Slavists.

It is my strong belief that the possibly unintentional effect of MS Plus previously having letters from pretty much all natural Slavic Latin scripts is not to be underestimated, as it helps create an emotional connection for any Latin writing Slav due to getting to use letters they write every day in their own languages. Forcing a shift of MS Plus towards an artificial, scientific system (with letter + diacritic combinations rather than naturally occurring letters, for instance) deprives us of this advantage, while not offering much in return -- and only needlessly discourages the use of MS Plus. A proper Scientific Interslavic alphabet would remedy this issue -- it would give us a nigh--perfect flavorization potential and the deepest knowledge about any word one could hope to gain, while allowing MS Plus to remain what it used to be -- just a "rich variant of Interslavic", basically.
