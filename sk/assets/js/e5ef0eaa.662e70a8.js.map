All Slavic languages are treated equally, although it cannot be avoided that a Slavic interlanguage is closer to „middle-of-the-road“ languages like Slovak or Rusyn than to peripheral languages like Sorbian or Macedonian. Interslavic is explicitly not meant to be „more Slavic than the Slavs“ by purifying it from foreign influences, even though a language based on the commonalities of the Slavic languages will automatically eliminate many local (non-Slavic) influences anyway.
